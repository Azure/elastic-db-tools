// Purpose:
// Defines the possible throttling modes in SQL Database.
//
// Notes:
// -This class was forked from the Windows Azure Transient Fault Handling Library ("Topaz")
//  available here: http://topaz.codeplex.com/ and will now be maintained by us. 
// - In the future, we should consider moving this to a config file to make updates
//  easier in-case WA Sql Database decides to change their throttling error codes.
